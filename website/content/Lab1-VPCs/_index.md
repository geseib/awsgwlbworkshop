## Lab 1 VPCs

This lab sets up the environment and shows some of the basic networking aspects of a internet-facing load-balanced application in an **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**.

We will  deploy two VPCs for applications, an Internet-facing load balanced application in 1 VPC, a VPC with 2 Palo Alto VMSeries firewall appliances, and the Transit Gateway. All this with a few clicks using **AWS Cloudformation**. You will then verify the internet app and connect to an EC2 instance and verify connectivity to the between via the VPCs.

The private IP address of the **EC2 Instance** in **VPC1** is **10.1.2.10** and the address of the **EC2 Instance** in **VPC2** is **10.2.2.10**.


The DNS address of the **internet-facing NLB** web application in **VPC1** will be generated by the Cloudformation stack. You can find it in the **outputs** tab of the cloudformation stack. it will look like **[*stack-name*]-NLB-internet-[*aws-generated-id*].elb.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com**
